**Preparing the Map for Export**

Add the necessary map elements: legend, title, and subtitle. Remember to set a scale that does not crop any of the small nations on the eastern and western edges of the map.

Consult [**Tutorial 1.10**](/1_Choropleth/1.10_Layout.md) and [**Tutorial 1.12**](/1_Choropleth/1.12_Advanced_Layout.md) if you need help in adding any of these features.

Export your map in your preferred format: SVG, PDF, or other.

To save your map, consult [**Tutorial 1.11**](/1_Choropleth/1.11_Save.md).

You have now completed the nominal map tutorial.

Visit [**Tutorial 4.1**](/4_Dot_Density/4.01_Dot_Setup.md) to learn how to make a Dot Density map, which is another thematic map type.
