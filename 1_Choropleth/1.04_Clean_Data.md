## Tutorial 1.4: Cleaning Attribute Data

**Summary**

**Tutorial 1.4** demonstrates how to "clean" the downloaded datasets. In this case, cleaning refers to preparatory steps needed to edit datasets collected from multiple sources so that they can be combined in mapping software. Data cleaning also can include checking for errors, eliminating unnecessary fields, and so on.

Becuase the data we downloaded are stored in an _xlsx_ file, or a spreadsheet, you need a spreadsheet editor to manipulate the file. While it is possible to do data cleaning directly wtihin QGIS, data cleaning of spreadsheets is often easier in spreasheed editing software. You are welcome to use whichever software is available. This demonstration uses _LibreOffice_ to edit the downloaded data. _LibreOffice_ is a freeware office software suite which includes both text and spreadsheet editors, among other programs. It can be [downloaded])(https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download-libreoffice/) for any operating system.

**Renaming Datasets**

Open *SG_GEN_PARL.xlsx* (percentage of women in parliament).

Rename these files to something easier to understand. Click *File,* then *Save As...* for *SG_GEN_PARL.xlsx* and name it *Per_Wom_Par.xlsx (Figure 1.4-1)*.

You created copies of the original files because you are going to edit the new files. Preserving the original file for future use is good data management practice.

**Converting to Qualitative Numbers**

Select the entire *2020* column in *Per_Wom_Par.xlsx* by clicking the header. The data are currently stored as text, not numbers, which is interpreted by mapping software as nominal-level or qualitative data. Choropleth maps require ordinal-level or ***quantitative*** (***interval*** or ***ratio***) data.

> ***Quantitative data***: interval- and ratio-level data together (see **Section 1.4** from the *[Mapping for a Sustainable World](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3898826)* book)

> ***Ratio level data***: attribute data that is quantitative values with a fixed zero (see **Section 1.4** from the *[Mapping for a Sustainable World](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3898826)* book)

> ***Interval-level data***: attribute data that is quantitative, but the zero value is arbitrary and, thus, limits estimation of relative magnitudes (see **Section 1.4** from the *[Mapping for a Sustainable World](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3898826)* book)

With the column selected, select Data > Text to Columns to enable QGIS to interpret the attribute as quantitative. The attributes also need to be converted to numbers for other ***data transformations***, such as normalization and classification. 

> ***Data transformation***: statistical conversion of an attribute (see **Section 1.7** from the *[Mapping for a Sustainable World](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3898826)* book)

You may notice, after the conversion, that the header value of '2020' has also been converted to a number with two decimal places. In general, it is poor practice to create purely numeric header values. To change the header value, select the header, and type in a value with a string at the beginning (i.e. 'p_2020').

**Combining Attribute Datasets**

For this map you only downloaded data from 2020. However, for future maps you may want to download all years if you revise your plan and decide to map temporal data (*Figure 1.4-2*, see **Section 3.9**).

**Converting to CSV**

Save the file again using your project folder. QGIS will not read the Excel file format, so save the data as a Comma Separated Value (CSV) file. Click *File→Save as…* and name the file *unwp.csv*. Switch the File Format to *Text CSV (.csv)* and click *Save*. 

Because this document has multiple spreadsheets, you will receive a minor error message. You can only save one spreadsheet at a time as a .csv file. You only need the sheet you have been working on, so click *OK*.

Now that your data is cleaned, proceed to [**Tutorial 1.5**: Creating a Project and Setting the Projection](/1_Choropleth/1.05_Project_and_Save.md).
