## Tutorial 1.6: Adding and Joining Attribute Data

**Summary**

**Tutorial 1.6** demonstrates how to add attribute data to the project and join layers *(Figure 1.6-1)*.

**Adding CSV Files**

In the Menu bar, click *Layer→Add Layer→Add Delimited Text Layer*. Click the three dots and add *unwp.csv* to the project. Do not change any settings. Click *Add* and close the window.

Check if the data imported properly. Right click *unwp* in the *Layers* panel and click *Open Attribute Table*. View the data to make sure you do not see any issues. Close the tab.

Since this is a CSV file, nothing new appears on the screen. It only contains attribute data, not location data.

**Joining GDB and CSV Files**

Right click on *UN_Countries_GDB-BNDA_simplified* in the *Layers* panel and click *Properties*. Click the *Joins* tab.

Click the green plus sign (![](1.6_Add_Data_images/image_1.png)). Join the data in this file to your csv *unwp*.

The *Join layer* should be your *unwp* file. 

Find a field that is the same between the two files. The computer will only make a join when the data in the two fields is exactly the same. Use the country names to join the data.

The *Join field* is the header of a field in the CSV file. The *Join field* is called *GeoAreaCode* and the *Target field* is called *m49_cd*. 

Click *OK* and then click *OK* again.

Open the Attribute Table for *UN_Countries_GDB-BNDA_simplified*. View the data to see if it has been joined correctly. Scroll to the middle to find the field *unwp_2020*. If some rows are NULL, that is okay. These are usually countries that do not have data. If all countries are NULL, then there was an issue with your *Join*. 

You may notice that there are a number of countries with data that did not join properly. This is because the *m49_cd* attribute is a string and not an integer, meaning codes that 
start with 0 or 00 will not join correctly. To change the attribute type, click *Processing* menu, then *Toolbox* and *Refactor*, selecting integer as the data type. Additional information about changing attribute types in QGIS is available at: https://wiki.tuflow.com/QGIS_Change_Attribute_Type

Remove the join and try again after updating the attribute type and editing any other inconsistencies you found between files.

**Creating a Permanent SHP Join**

Once you are satisfied with your join, you need to make the join permanent in a new file. Save *UN_Countries_GDB-BNDA_simplified* as a new shapefile. Right click *UN_Countries_GDB-BNDA_simplified* in the *Layers* panel and click *Export→Save features as…*

Click the three dots and name your file *UN_wom_par_eiv.shp*, as you do not need a full geodatabase for this tutorial. Confirm *Add saved file to the map* is selected and click *OK*. 

Remove all layers except for *UN_wom_par_eiv*. Right click each file and click *Remove Layer…* and then *OK*. 

Now you have added all the necessary layers and joined them together. Save and proceed to [**Tutorial 1.7**: Editing the Attribute Table](/1_Choropleth/1.7_Edit_Attribute_table_Map_Algebra.md).
