## Tutorial 6.2: Recommendations for Reprojecting in QGIS

**Summary**

**Tutorial 6.2** is similar to Tutorial 1.5, but demonstrates how to project the map when beginning with an unprojected shapefile (*Figure 6.2-1*).

**Downloading Natural Earth Data**

If you are not using the world shapefile from the UN, there are many places you can download shapefiles. Many government databases have shapefiles, for example.

One of the most popular places to download open-source world shapefile is *Natural Earth*, a website curated and updated by numerous cartographers and organizations.

Open the [Downloads](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/) page on the Natural Earth website.

The website contains three scales for your shapefile. Large scale is very detailed, while small scale is less detailed. The *Cultural* tabs includes human-made concepts such as nations (borders) and cities. The *Physical* tab includes naturally occuring features such as bodies of water. The *Raster* tab includes land cover and shaded relief files.

Under the *Medium* scale, click the *Cultural* tab.

You may wish to explore the types of data available here. Once done, *Download countries* under the first heading, *Admin 0 - Countries*. Once downloaded, move the file to your project folder and unzip the file.

**Creating a Project**

Open QGIS. Click *New Empty Project*.

In the Menu bar (top of the screen) click *Layer→Add Layer→Add Vector Layer*.

The *Data Source Manager | Vector* window will open. 

Click the icon with three dots (![](6.02_Recommendations_Reprojecting_images/image_1.png)) toward the right of the screen. Navigate to the folder where you are storing your project files. Select *ne_50m_admin_0_countries.shp* and then click *Add*.

**Setting the Shapefile Projection**

Close this window. There is a world map on the screen. This map is not ***projected*** (*Figure 1.5-2*). It currently uses a geographic coordinate system to tell the software how to read the file, but this is not a projected coordinate system.

> ***Projection***: the process of transferring geospatial data from a three-dimensional model of the Earth to a two-dimensional or "flat" map (see **Section 2.4**)

Since you are making a choropleth map, which relies on area, you want to reduce distortion of area. However, this means you will distort shape. Use the Eckert IV projection, which is a common ***equal-area projection*** for world maps.

> ***Equal-area projection***: a projection that preserves the relative areas of polygon features, often heavily distorting shape as a result

To change the projection, right click on *ne_50m_admin_0_countries* in the *Layers* panel (bottom left of the screen). Click *Export→Save features as…*

Click the icon with three dots. Navigate to your project folder. Name the file something memorable like *reprojected_map_eckert_iv.shp* and click *Save*.

Under CRS, change the projection. Click the globe (![](6.02_Recommendations_Reprojecting_images/image_3.png)) and search for the Eckert IV projection. Select *Sphere_Eckert_IV* which has the EPSG code 53012.

Click *OK*. Confirm *Add saved file to map* is checked and click *OK*.

**Setting the Project Projection**

After this step, the map does not look different. Your file is saved in the Eckert IV projection, but the project is not.

Before the next step, note that QGIS will sometimes display an error at this stage. In the *Layers* panel, a Question Mark (![](6.02_Recommendations_Reprojecting_images/image_4.png)) may appear next to the file name. If you have this error, click the Question Mark. Select the *Sphere_Eckert_IV* projection again and click *OK*.

In the Menu bar go to *Project→Properties…* and click the *CRS* tab. The Eckert IV projection should appear in *Recently Used Coordinate Reference Systems*. Select *Sphere_Eckert_IV* and click *OK*.

In the Layers panel, right click on *ne_50m_admin_0_countries* and click *Remove Layer*, then click *OK*. 

Because you added a reprojected shapefile, you no longer need the original *name* shapefile. 

Save your project. In the Menu bar, go to *Project→Save as…* and name your project something memorable like *SDG_choropleth_tutorial_map*. Save it in the project folder.

**Setting the Scale**

At this stage it is important to think about ***scale***. The polygons representing location can have generalized or complex linework depending on the scale (*Figure 1.5-3*). From Natural Earth, you chose a medium level of generalization. If you do not like the look, you could download the more detailed or less detailed shapefile.

> ***Cartographic scale***: the ratio between a distance represented on a map and the corresponding distance in the real world (see **Section 2.6**)
