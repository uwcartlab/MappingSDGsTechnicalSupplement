## Tutorial 2.2: Projecting Map and Adding Data

**Summary**

**Tutorial 2.2** demonstrates how to add locational data to QGIS and to project the map (*Figure 2.2-1*).

**Using a European Projection**

Open QGIS. Click *New Empty Project*.

Import the *BNDA_simplified.shp* file. Refer to [**Tutorial 1.5**](/1_Choropleth/1.05_Project_and_Save.md) for more detail.

In the choropleth tutorial, you used the default *Sphere_Eckert_IV* projection, a worldwide projection. However, this map is centered on Europe. Therefore, a worldwide projection is not the best choice.

To change the projection, right click on *BNDA_simplified* in the *Layers* panel (bottom left of the screen). Click *Export→Save features as…*

Click the icon with three dots. Navigate to your project folder. Name the file something memorable like *reprojected_map_europe_albers.shp* and click *Save*.

Under CRS, change the projection. Click the globe (![](/2_Proportional_Symbol/2.02_project_and_data_images/image_1.png)) and search for the word *Europe* and expand *Predefined Coordinate Reference Systems* to see the options for Europe-specific projections.

*Apply* multiple projections to see how they differ. Then, select *Europe_Albers_Equal_Area_Conic* for this project. While equal area projections are required for choropleth maps, they are not required for proportional symbol maps. This is because proportional symbol maps rely on a symbol on top of the geographic area, not the geographic area itself. However, using an equal area projection is still common.

Click *OK*. Confirm *Add saved file to map* is checked and click *OK*.

**Setting the Project Projection**

After this step, the map does not look different. Your file is saved in the Europe Albers Equal Area projection, but the project is not.

Before the next step, note that QGIS will sometimes display an error at this stage. In the *Layers* panel, a Question Mark (![](/2_Proportional_Symbol/2.02_project_and_data_images/image_2.png)) may appear next to the file name. If you have this error, click the Question Mark. Select the *Europe_Albers_Equal_Area_Conic* projection again and click *OK*.

In the Menu bar go to *Project→Properties…* and click the *CRS* tab. The Europe Albers Equal Area projection should appear in *Recently Used Coordinate Reference Systems*. Select *Europe_Albers_Equal_Area_Conic* and click *OK*.

In the Layers panel, right click on *BNDA_simplified* and click *Remove Layer*, then click *OK*. 

Because you added a reprojected shapefile, you no longer need the original shapefile.

In QGIS, there can sometimes be issues with reprojecting files. It may look weird at first, but once you zoom in to Europe the file will look normal again.

**Joining CSV Files**

Import the CSV file. 

Join *unid* with *reprojected_map_europe_albers* through the Country Name or ISO code fields.

Refer to [**Tutorial 1.6**](/1_Choropleth/1.06_Add_Data.md) for more detail on joins.

Export this new file with the name *UN_inf_mor_albers.shp* and remove all other layers.

You have now added the location data and projected it properly. Save and proceed to [**Tutorial 2.3**: Extracting European Countries and Centroids](/2_Proportional_Symbol/2.03_select_europe_and_centroids.md).
