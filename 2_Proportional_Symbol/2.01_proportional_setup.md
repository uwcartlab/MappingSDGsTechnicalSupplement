## Tutorial 2.1: Overview and Setup

**Summary**

**Tutorial 2.1** demonstrates how to make the ***proportional symbol map*** on page 65, which displays SDG Target 3.2.1: "By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births" *(Figure 2.1-1)*.

This is the second in a set of tutorials paired with *Mapping for a Sustainable World*. The first tutorial teaches you how to create a choropleth map. Completion of the previous tutorial is not required to complete the proportional symbol map tutorial. However, the choropleth tutorial is a specific, step-by-step tutorial. The proportional symbol map tutorial is less specific and asks you to refer to the previous tutorial for a "how to", rather than describing each step in absolute detail.

> ***Proportional symbol map***: a thematic map that uses the visual variable size to scale point symbols by their attribute values (see **Section 3.4**)

**Tutorial 2.1** covers the same instructions as **Tutorials 1.1** through **1.4**

**Scope**

Before beginning the map creation process, always consider the scope of your project. This includes: 

* Define the Project Goals
* Review Available Datasets
* Clean and Reformat Data
* Transform and Analyze the Data for Insights
* Execute the Map Design
* Evaluate and Edit the Map Design

Refer to [**Tutorial 1.1**](/1_Choropleth/1.01_Scope.md) or **Section 2.2** of the *Mapping for a Sustainable World* book for more detail.

**Download QGIS**

If this is your first time using QGIS, refer to [**Tutorial 1.2**](/1_Choropleth/1.02_Download_QGIS.md) to download it.

**Download Location and Attribute Data**

On your computer, create a project folder called *SDG_proportional_tutorial*. 

Follow [**Tutorial 1.3**](/1_Choropleth/1.03_Download_Data.md) to download the data. Every step is the same, except this time you will be downloading SDG Indicator 3.2.1 *Infant deaths (number)*. Because proportional symbol maps rely on symbols rather than geographic area, they do not need to be normalized like choropleth maps. Ensure you download the numbers file rather than the rate file.

**Clean Attribute Data**

Resave the *SH_DYN_IMRTN.xlsx* file as *Tot_Inf_Mor.xlsx*. Open the new file and convert the 2020 column to numeric. 

Export this file as a CSV called *unid.csv*.

Refer to [**Tutorial 1.4**](/1_Choropleth/1.04_Clean_Data.md) for more detail on how to complete these steps.

Save and proceed to [**Tutorial 2.2**: Projecting Map and Adding Data](/2_Proportional_Symbol/2.02_project_and_data.md).
