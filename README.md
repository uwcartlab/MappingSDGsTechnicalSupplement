## About

These tutorials pair with the open-source textbook *[Mapping for a Sustainable World](https://digitallibrary.un.org/record/3898826)*. The textbook teaches principles of cartography through the United Nations' 17 ***Sustainable Development Goals***. *Mapping for a Sustainable World* was developed as a collaboration between the United Nations and the International Cartographic Association with the University of Wisconsin Cartography Lab supporting creation of the book layout and all maps and graphics through [National Science Foundation CAREER Grant #1555267](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1555267).

All tutorials demonstrate map design using the open access mapping software [QGIS](https://qgis.org/en/site/). Thus, the objective of these tutorials is to enhance the cartographic design thinking described in *Mapping for a Sustainable World* with technical map software training, putting concepts into practice.

The tutorials were developed by Lily Houtman, Gareth Baldrica-Franklin, and Robert E. Roth of the [University Wisconsin Cartography Lab](https://geography.wisc.edu/cartography/) under NSF #1555267 and are freely available for personal or classroom/workshop use following a CC BY-NC license.

## How to Use These Tutorials

There are three sets of tutorials that follow the technical design and implementation of a choropleth, proportional symbol, nominal map, and dot density map from _Mapping for a Sustainable World_. The tutorials also describe how to export a QGIS layout as SVG for use in graphic design software and provide some notes on how to repurpose the content for different instrutional contexts. The tutorials are meant to be created sequentially and use a number 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, etc., to indicate the sequence.

The tutorials are meant to enhance but not replicate information from *Mapping for a Sustainable World*. Keywords from *Mapping for a Sustainable World* use bold and italics and are followed with the definition from the glossary offset with a reference to the relevant book section (Note: *Mapping for a Sustainable World* uses British English).
